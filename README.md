### Hi there üëã


### Who am I, and what can I do for you? 
Hi! I'm Rinaldo. 

I develop applications for the web with a keen eye on usefulness and usability. (Fan of Psychology and Philosophy üßòüèΩ)


Armed with the following skills and experiences, I'm able to build web applications that solve niche problems through technology. *I'm currently exploring frontend landscape with React. *

### Technologies I use for the web:
###### (Click to expand them to read more)

#### Backend (Python focused)
<details>
    <summary>FastAPI/Flask and comfortable with most things on the block. </summary>
  
  Been using Flask for more than 3 years now, and has built two ecommerce application, a completely from-the-scratch CRM for an edtech/fashion organization. Has also built a blog engine with it. Recently got an opportunity to work on FastAPI to build a micro-services architecture for an NLP-as-a-service engine, and loved its modern take on web application servers.

<details>
	<summary>Celery, Redis
	</summary>
	
Have used celery for scheduling notifications, which made me search for better alternatives üòÖ and ended up using RedisQueue, and TaskTiger, which gave me a fair experience with redis as high-performance minimal storage. 
</details>

#### Frontend
<details>
	<summary>HTML5/CSS3</summary>
	Modern HTML5 has added some pretty sweet semantic tags that people often fail to use. I'm a fan of separation of concerns, because that enables debugging a lot more cleaner and both HTML5 and CSS3 does a fantastic job of enabling that. 
	I love CSS3, with all the modern spec - Grid, Flex, and waiting for container queries. üòá That will change the game. I am familiar with both Sass and PostCSS to enable cleaner and compatible CSS code across browsers, and versions.
</details>

<details>
	<summary>JS</summary>
	> "What can be done in JS, will be done in JS"
	
I read this quote from a famous frontend dev, and in all honesty, this is true. ES6, and TS is enabling the modern web, and it will only evolve better in the coming years. * I'm just starting with JS,* and I'm really excited to build things for the web, and desktop. 
	
</details>

<details>
	<summary>ReactJS</summary>
	React really changed the game of frontend frameworks and thought process. React hooks, although does a lot of auto-magical stuff, enables a really scalable and quick development turn-around time. I'm currently working on react building an internal social network. 
</details>


<details>
	<summary>Figma</summary>
	Figma redefined the way we design for the web, and software. I love working with it so much so that I use it for more than just plain UI design. The infinite canvas is my holy grail of thought, mind-maps, designs, and thought palace. Been using Figma for more than a year and I love how beautifully they have crafted the usability of the application. It's my go-to case study for a SaaS application
</details>

#### Databases

<details>
	<summary> Postgres/MySql</summary>
	My go-to database (apart from SQLite for test purposes) is Postgres. I believe PostgreSQL DB is the epitome of relational databases with an incredible performance, so much so that there are forks of it handling modern niche usecases (EdgeDB, TigerGraph) with a totally different paradigm. 
	Although I have used MySql in the past, I rarely prefer it over Postgres. 
	
</details>

<details>
	<summary>MongoDB</summary>
	I have used MongoDB for write-intensive applications and built a CRM and a blog with that. I'd not prefer Mongo over Postgres in most cases, and especially when performance matters. Where there are equally, if not more edits on the data, I prefer Postgres. 
	
</details>

<details>
	<summary>Comfortable with graph/multi-model databases: ArangoDB, OngDB</summary>
	As part of a team building an NLP platform for chatbots, I have used Neo4j, and later moved onto OngDB (due to restrictions) and loved the paradigm shift from relational/non-relational DB into Graph DB. 
	And then I encountered ArangoDB and absolutely loved its AQL, and multi-modal capabilities. Built an NLP-as-a-service engine with it as a solo developer, and I loved the developer experience with it. Would definitely try again. 
</details>


#### Machine learning / AI
##### Frameworks

<details>
	<summary>Tensorflow/Pytorch</summary>
	Have used both TensorFlow and Pytorch for both NLP and CV applications. Although liked the performance aspect of tensorflow, I appreciated the modern style of idiomatic code in PyTorch.
	
</details>


##### Domains
 - NLP
	 
	<details>
		<summary>Spacy/NLTK/AllenNLP/Snips</summary>
		A fan of Spacy since my college days and been using it since the early days when NLTK was the only go-to solution for NLP. AllenNLP with its modern datasets and models, is a boon for developers who love hacking all-things-NLP. 
	
	</details>
	
 - Compupter Vision
	 <details>
		<summary>OpenCV</summary>
		"The" computer vision library that shall prevail the end of our era - Although the developer experience isn't as optimal as in the domain of NLP (thanks, spacy!) the performance is alluring. Built a realtime multi-camera, Multi-person tracking system with plain OpenCV and achieved a really good performance. 
	</details>


##### DevOps/Deployment

<details>
		<summary>Docker/Ansible</summary>
Although my experience with DevOps is limited, I liked working with Docker and how much it enabled modern micro-services architecture to build high-throughput, high-traffic web applications. 
	And even with negligible experience I loved using ansible. However, today I prefer Github Actions/ GitLab CI because of developer experience for CI/CD. 
</details>

#### Tools/technologies/platforms

<details>
		<summary>Git (Have used GitHub/GitLab/BitBucket)</summary>
I strongly believe that Git enabled the world of software development to be truly asynchronous. And despite all the modern platforms, and GUI tools, I love using Git from command-line to remind myself of how powerful software can be. 
</details>

<details>
		<summary> IDEs (VSCode, Pycharm)</summary>
I'd without skipping a beat vouch for modern developer tools and how much they play a role in our modern tech world. Been using Pycharm and VSCode for years, and I'm comfortable using the powerful features of them. 
</details>

##### Misc
- I write. A lot. From technical, non-fiction, to fiction, I can do it with utmost diligence. 
	- Checkout my technical writing [here](https://dev.to/rinaldorex/on-mutualism-of-tech-scm-vcs-giants-32dk) and samples of my fiction over here on [medium](https://medium.com/@rinaldorex) but my extensive research + personal exploration with non-technical writings can be found on my personal _book_ at [rinaldo-rex.github.io](https://rinaldo-rex.github.io/)
- I am good with pencil sketching (which aids in my _designing_ of applications today!), and photography.  [Really](https://www.instagram.com/rinaldorex/) 

In addition to the above, I'm comfortable learning/adapting to modern technologies as long as they don't deviate massively in the domains.



### Looking to hire? 

I'm always open to any new and *interesting* opportunities, but some or all of the following will grab my priority. 

###### Work/Life balance
With years of experience developing some of the complex applications for multiple startups, I have gathered skills technically so much so that I can hop onto any new technology pretty quickly without much hassle. But I'm currently looking to improve myself personally and ** I take work-life balance very seriously. ** I strongly believe that who I'm personally, reflects who I am professionally. 

I go by the following principle to guide me to find the balance. 
> He who does not take breaks seriously, cannot take work seriously.

If you employ a 4-day work week, I'm more than certain that I can deliver better than a traditional week. This tops all the other priorities currently. 

###### Fully remote positions
I have a good chunk of my professional experience working remotely for multiple startups (Yes, even before Covid) and I'm good at what I do asynchronously. I like to give my deep-work sessions as much time as possible, so I prefer fully remote positions to deliver some of my best contributions.

As someone who's very keen on writing, I'm good at communicating things lucidly in writing, and documenting things for other people within and outside the team. 

I've managed multiple teams remotely and I find it cleaner to manage and mentor people remotely. And as such, I'm efficient working remotely and my current stance in life due to personal reasons makes me prefer remote work. 

###### Opportunity to learn and explore
By learning opportunity, I do not mean subscriptions to Skillshare, Udemy, etc (Although I would like that), but the opportunity to learn different skills cross-team and cross-domain, the freedom to try and implement new things, and finally, the time and mental space to do so. 

Most of my professional experience comes from a self-taught nature, and I'd absolutely love it when I'm provided the space for the same. And rest assured, I'm sure to bring in all these new knowledge, insights, and some of the best practices to those that I work with. 

#### Current exploration
- Exploring frontend as I'm fairly confident and comfortable with the backend. (Been doing that for most of my developer life). Using ReactJS - Architecting, building, and improving my UI/UX skills. 
- Apart from work, I'm diving deep into some schools of philosophies recently - Absurdism and Taoism are my top picks currently. 

#### What people say about me 
###### Some of my proud moments! ü•∫

> His perseverance and dedication at this young age will definitely make others jealous. He had single-handedly managed a couple of complex projects that require extreme competence of his effort every day for 8-10 months. He is a natural leader with an extra layer of empathy coated in his DNA. I wish he could lead an R&D team that will witness a greater amount of innovation in that space. He leads the life in a simple way, read-work-teach-celebrate.
